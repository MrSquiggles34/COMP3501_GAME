This land has both technology and mother nature on its side.\nStill, my genius has prevailed as was to be expected. My submarine design worked perfectly in taking me all the way to shore.

They won't until it's completed. But by then it will be too late.\nThen they will TRULY understand the depth of what they have taken away from me.");

How could they not understand my vision?\nIf my plans were to be realized, I would be playing on the same playing field as God himself.\nNot only do they rob me of my grandson by denying him care, they won't even let me fix what they've done! Calling it blasphemy.\nThey dare deny him his right to live!? His right to be reborn anew!?\nHe was perfect in every way, he could have become a greater mind than I. Yet his future was cut so short.\nNo. I will not allow this to happen.\nI will deliver justice.");
